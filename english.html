Once again, we see another oddity in comparison to the other works, this one being not an essay, passage, or paper but, a chart showing a breakdown of the fairly well-known characters of "The Great Gatsby", though this may not display my growth in writing as a whole, it shows my improvement in analysis. My analytical skills have always been dull in my opinion with too much often being lost on me and going over my head but, by taking time to carefully look at and compare aspects of text, many things become more clear. By taking a moment to examine the relationships between each of the characters in the book, seeing how they view one another, thinking from multiple perspectives, I began to understand the complexity of it as a whole and by doing this, gained experience which could be applied to better understand many other stories similar to this.

This piece is one of my favourites, simply due to the fact of it being more focused on narrative writing rather than expository or arguementative stlye writing. However, because of that difference this paper becomes an oddity when put in comparison with other works through out the year but, a fair bit of growth is still exemplified in this as far as pure positives. This story was an excercise in engaging the reader in a new way, something that many of my earlier papers did not have and I was given the opportunity to do so in a way that I enjoyed, narrative. There were many methods that I attempted to use in this to "invest" the reader in the text, simple things such as the repetition of a particular sentence or onamonapia, to more in depth techniques such as keeping the description of the protagonist unknown to the reader so that they might project themselves onto him and further be "pulled into" the story.

This essay was written a fair time after the previous essay and is a major improvement. Within this paper I drastically bettered both the length of my essay, significantly so, as well, I "sorted out" my ability to engage in discussion with the reader through providing meaningful "real-world" examples such as the "Hope for Japan" campaign and things like it. Yet, by fixing this problem I did work to reveal another issue similar to it, my near total ignoring of any kind of concession or counter-argument, even if only a theoretical one. And by looking back to the previous example we begin to notice this problem still there. But, this was overshadowed by my lack of discussion.

This being one of my earliest works, it is most likely my worst. This was written as a reflection to the quote in the passage itself. There are many poor points that have remained somewhat consistent in my writing, one such being the most obvious, its length. The essay is laughably short, the absolute bare minimum, the little amount of content obviously makes for a lacking paper and are nothing more to a detriment to it. Another poor quality you see is my ignorance of depth in discussion, this was something pointed out by Mr. Davis as well, I glaze over possible points for discussion, this might be due to the length but is an issue nonetheless. However, you do also see one positive aspect that has remained in my work, my more creative writing prowess. Though that may be an exaggeration, it's a quality of note, in the piece I focus on the word "literally" in multiple ways, by both taking time to define the word and highlight it at various parts of the essay.
